"""
Main entry point for the Discord Bot.

This script initializes the bot, loads configurations, sets up necessary intents,
registers slash commands, defines event handlers (like on_ready), and runs the bot.
It leverages other modules for specific functionalities:
- `config_loader.py`: For loading JSON configurations.
- `bot_commands.py`: For defining and registering slash commands.
