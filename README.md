# Discord Order & Diagnostic Bot

A simple and extendable Discord bot that handles **order forms**, runs **diagnostic checks**, and **sends confirmation emails to users**. With fun features and utility tools on the way, this bot is perfect for community servers and service-based Discord communities.

This bot is designed for Discord servers that need a basic but reliable tool to:

- Collect orders using command-based forms (e.g., `/order`)
- Run simple diagnostics or bot status checks (e.g., `/diagnostics`, `/ping`)
- Automatically send order confirmation emails to users (configurable)

Perfect for growing communities, service-based servers (e.g., digital services, commissions), or development showcases.

## üß± Project Structure

Here's how the bot's codebase is organized to keep things clean and easy to understand:

-   **[`bot/main.py`](bot/main.py)**: The main entry point for the Discord bot. Initializes the bot, loads configurations, sets up commands (via `bot_commands.py`), and connects to Discord.
-   **[`bot/config_loader.py`](bot/config_loader.py)**: Handles loading of configurations from [`config/config.json`](config/config.json) (for general settings like SMTP) and [`config/email_template.json`](config/email_template.json) (for email content).
-   **[`bot/email_utils.py`](bot/email_utils.py)**: Contains functions for sending emails (including order confirmations using `aiosmtplib`) and validating email addresses.
-   **[`bot/discord_ui.py`](bot/discord_ui.py)**: Defines the multi-step Discord modals (`OrderFormStep1`, `OrderFormStep2`, `OrderFormStep3`) and UI helper functions used in the order submission process.
-   **[`bot/bot_commands.py`](bot/bot_commands.py)**: Contains the definitions and logic for all slash commands available to the bot (e.g., `/ping`, `/order_form`, `/run_diagnostics`).
-   **[`.env.example`](.env.example)**: An example file showing the required environment variables. You should copy this to `.env` and fill in your credentials.
-   **[`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)**: Lists all Python package dependencies.
-   **[`config/config.json`](config/config.json)**: Configuration file for non-sensitive settings, like SMTP server and port.
-   **[`config/email_template.json`](config/email_template.json)**: JSON file defining the HTML body and other parts of the confirmation email.

## üîß Configuration Guide

Setting up the bot involves configuring your Discord Bot Token, email credentials, and potentially SMTP settings.

### Step 1: Create a Discord Bot Application

1.  Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2.  Click **‚ÄúNew Application‚Äù**, give it a name, and agree to the terms.
3.  Navigate to the **Bot** tab on the left sidebar.
4.  Click **‚ÄúAdd Bot‚Äù** and confirm.
5.  Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable:
    *   **Presence Intent** (Optional, but good for some diagnostic features or future enhancements)
    *   **Message Content Intent** (Required if you plan to use prefix commands or read message content; less critical for slash-command-only bots but good to enable for flexibility).
6.  Go to **OAuth2 > URL Generator** (under OAuth2 section):
    *   In "Scopes", select `bot` and `applications.commands`.
    *   In "Bot Permissions" below, select necessary permissions. For ease of setup, you can select `Administrator`, but for production, grant only the permissions your bot truly needs (e.g., Send Messages, Read Message History, Embed Links).
    *   Copy the generated URL and paste it into your browser to invite the bot to your Discord server.

### Step 2: Get the Bot Token

-   In the **Bot** tab of your application on the Discord Developer Portal, click **‚ÄúReset Token‚Äù** (or "View Token" if available).
-   Copy the token. This is your `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`. **Treat this like a password and never share it publicly.**

### Step 3: Set Up Gmail App Password (If Using Gmail for Sending Emails)

If you intend to use a Gmail account to send confirmation emails, you'll need an "App Password" if Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is enabled on that Google account.

1.  Go to your Google [Account Settings > Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
2.  Ensure **2-Step Verification** is enabled.
3.  Go to [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) (you might need to sign in again).
4.  Under "Select app", choose **Mail**.
5.  Under "Select device", choose **Other (Custom name)**.
6.  Name it (e.g., "Discord Bot Orders") and click **Generate**.
7.  Copy the 16-character generated App Password. This will be your `SENDER_PASSWORD`.

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables and JSON Files

This bot uses a `.env` file for sensitive credentials and JSON files (`config.json`, `email_template.json`) for other settings.

**A. Environment Variables (`.env` file):**

1.  In the root directory of the project, find the file named `.env.example`.
2.  Create a copy of `.env.example` and rename the copy to `.env`.
3.  Open the `.env` file with a text editor.
4.  Fill in your actual credentials:
    *   `SENDER_EMAIL`: The email address the bot will use to send emails (e.g., your Gmail address).
    *   `SENDER_PASSWORD`: The password for the sender's email account (e.g., the Gmail App Password you generated).
    *   `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: The Discord bot token you copied in Step 2.

    Example `.env` content:
    ```env
    # .env (example, replace with your actual values)
    SENDER_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
    SENDER_PASSWORD=youractualapppassword
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=youractualdiscordbottoken
    ```
    **Important:** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file if it's not already there. This prevents you from accidentally committing your sensitive credentials to version control.

**B. Non-Sensitive Settings (`config.json`):**

The `config.json` file is used for non-sensitive configurations, primarily the SMTP server and port for sending emails. Default values are provided for Gmail.

```json
{
  "smtp_server": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "smtp_port": 587
}
```
If you are using a different email provider, update `smtp_server` and `smtp_port` in `config.json` accordingly. The optional SMTP variables mentioned in `.env.example` (`SMTP_SERVER`, `SMTP_PORT`) are for user reference if they choose to customize the email sending logic to prioritize environment variables for these settings (current code does not do this by default).

**C. Email Template (`email_template.json`):**

The `email_template.json` file defines the content of the order confirmation email. You can customize the `html_body` (which supports placeholders like `{{product_name}}`) and other email fields here.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Bot

Once all configurations are set up (see [Configuration Guide](#-configuration-guide) above):

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3.  Run the bot using Python:

```bash
python bot/main.py
```

If everything is configured correctly, you should see messages in your console indicating the bot has logged in and is ready. Ensure your bot is invited to a server and has the necessary permissions.

## ‚ú® Recent Improvements & Refactoring

This bot has undergone significant enhancements to improve security, reliability, and maintainability:

-   **Modular Codebase**: The project has been refactored into multiple Python modules (`main.py`, `config_loader.py`, `email_utils.py`, `discord_ui.py`, `bot_commands.py`) for better organization and separation of concerns.
-   **Secure Credential Management**: Sensitive credentials (Bot Token, Sender Email, Sender Password) are managed securely using environment variables via a `.env` file, loaded by `python-dotenv`. An `.env.example` file is provided as a template.
-   **Asynchronous Operations**: Email sending now uses `aiosmtplib` for asynchronous SMTP communication, improving bot responsiveness by not blocking other operations.
-   **Standardized Slash Commands**: All primary bot commands have been implemented as Discord slash commands for a modern user experience.
-   **Improved UI for Orders**: The order submission process uses a sequence of Discord Modals for a better user interface.
-   **Concurrency Support**: Order form data handling is designed to manage data for multiple users concurrently using a dictionary within the bot instance.
-   **Detailed Error Handling**: Email sending includes specific exception handling for `aiosmtplib` errors. Bot startup includes checks for critical configurations like `BOT_TOKEN`.
-   **Configurable Settings**: SMTP server/port are configurable via `config.json`. The email content is templated in `email_template.json`.
-   **SMTP TLS Error Fix**: Resolved an "SMTP General Error: Connection already using TLS" by removing a redundant `STARTTLS` command in `email_utils.py`. The `aiosmtplib` library now correctly handles the TLS negotiation automatically when using port 587.
