# Discord Order & Diagnostic Bot

A simple and extendable Discord bot that handles **order forms**, runs **diagnostic checks**, and even **sends confirmation emails to users just like StockX**! With fun features and utility tools on the way, this bot is perfect for community servers and service-based Discords.

This bot is designed for Discord servers that need a basic but reliable tool to:

- Collect orders using command-based forms (e.g., `/order`)
- Run simple diagnostics or bot status checks (e.g., `/diagnostics`)
- Automatically send order confirmation emails to users (configurable)
- Eventually include fun community features and helpful utilities!

Perfect for growing communities, service-based servers (e.g., digital services, commissions), or development showcases.

## üîß Configuration Guide

### Step 1: Create a Discord Bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **‚ÄúNew Application‚Äù** ‚Üí Name it ‚Üí Go to **Bot** tab ‚Üí Click **‚ÄúAdd Bot‚Äù**
3. Turn ON:
   - **Presence Intent**
   - **Message Content Intent**
4. Go to **OAuth2 > URL Generator**
   - Scopes: `bot`
   - Bot Permissions: `Administrator`
   - Copy the generated link and invite the bot to your Discord server

### Step 2: Get the Bot Token

- In the Bot tab, click ‚ÄúReset Token‚Äù ‚Üí Copy it (you‚Äôll use this in config)

### Step 3: Set Up Gmail App Password

To send confirmation emails, you need a Gmail "App Password":

1. Go to your Google [Account Settings > Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Enable **2-Step Verification**
3. Go to [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
4. Select **Mail**, device: "Other" ‚Üí Name it anything ‚Üí Copy password

### Step 4: Configure Bot Settings

This bot uses a combination of a `.env` file for sensitive credentials and `config.json` for other, non-sensitive settings.

**Sensitive Credentials (`.env` file):**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will store your Discord Bot Token, Sender Email, and Email Password. The application uses the `python-dotenv` library to load these variables automatically.

Add the following lines to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```env
# .env (example)
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_actual_bot_token
SENDER_EMAIL=your_sender_email@example.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=your_email_password
```

**Important:** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing your secrets to version control. If you don't have a `.gitignore` file, create one in the root directory and add `.env` to it.

**Non-Sensitive Settings (`config.json`):**

The `config.json` file is used for non-sensitive configurations, such as the SMTP server and port. Default values are provided for Gmail.

```json
{
  "email": "",
  "email_password": "",
  "bot_token": "",
  "smtp_server": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "smtp_port": 587
}
```
The `email`, `email_password`, and `bot_token` fields in `config.json` are placeholders and are overridden by the values in your `.env` file.

Save both files after making your changes.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Bot

## ‚ú® Recent Improvements

This bot has undergone several enhancements to improve security, reliability, and maintainability:

- **Enhanced Security**: Sensitive credentials (Bot Token, Sender Email, Sender Password) have been moved from `config.json` to environment variables managed via a `.env` file.
- **Improved Concurrency**: Order form data handling has been refactored to support multiple concurrent users without data conflicts.
- **Detailed Error Logging**: Email sending functionality now includes more specific error catching and logging for `aiosmtplib` exceptions, aiding in troubleshooting.
- **Code Refactoring**:
    - UI `TextInput` components are now created using a dedicated helper function, making the modal definitions cleaner.
    - Email sending has been transitioned to `aiosmtplib`, enabling asynchronous operations and improving bot responsiveness.
- **Standardized Commands**: Bot commands are being standardized to use Discord's slash command interface (e.g., `/ping` now includes latency).
- **Configurable SMTP**: SMTP server and port are now configurable via `config.json`, providing flexibility for different email providers.
